# Data Analytics Projects


[Project 1: NFL Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/kjdum/portfolio/blob/main/NFL%20Python%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb)

![1stD_Boxplot](/assets/1stD_boxplot.jpg)

This project builds a machine learning model in python to predict NFL game outcomes based on team stats accumulated in past games.

- Data is taken from Pro Football Reference datasets.
- This project is focused on python and using linear regression.
- The model is optimized to produce the high accuracy predictions.


[Project 2: SQL Customer Churn Rate](https://github.com/kjdum/portfolio/blob/main/postgreSQL_acquisition.pdf)

![Churn_ERD](/assets/Churn_ERD.jpg)

This project involves crafting a reasearch question and using SQL to answer the question.

- Data involves on site database and importing a table from a csv file.
- Includes Entity Relationship Diagram.
- Two tables are joined in a CTE to create a query that finds the overall customer churn rate.


[Project 3: R Data Cleaning Churn Dataset](https://github.com/kjdum/portfolio/blob/main/Data_cleaning_churn.pdf)

![PCA_loadings](/assets/PCA_loadings.jpg)

I clean a dataset and perform PCA on quantitative, continuous variables.

- Data comes from a telecommunication csv file used for analyzing the business.
- Focuses on detection and removal of: duplicates, missing values, outliers, and re-expression of categorical variables.
- The cleaned dataset is then taken and PCA is performed.
